			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types & Variables </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 5 was to practice experimenting with basic data types and assigning 
						variables in JavaScript. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p> A problem that arose was navigating how to delcare a boolean variable. 
						I had trouble individually declaring the "Ownit" variable and understanding how to get a true or false output. 
						In the end, I figured it out and I assigned the variable to a false answer as I do not own the vehicle. 
						 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> This assignment was fairly straightforward as it was just practice assigning variables to words in JavaScript. 
						I followed Wes' instructions and got the output results I desired. For this task,
						 I used my friend's 2010 Silver Subaru Outback as an example car, given that I mainly travel on the bus. 
						 I enjoyed making css stylistic changes and using heading, div, paragraphs tags to oragnize my page. </p>

			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions </h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The goal of this lab is to work with your partner, write functions that take user input,
                        and manipulate a string.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> For the most part, Lab 7 was simple. However, a challenge I had was the initial file creation. 
                        The previous labs already had a file a structure on Visual Studios with index.html, css, img, and js folders but
                        Lab 7 was starting from scratch. I was able to learn how to create a new file structure pretty fast after 
                        referencing the files pre-made for the course. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My lab 7 went pretty smoothly, the directions were straightforward and simple. 
                        It was useful and informative to practice functions and manipulate elements of a string.
                        I successfully linked all my files together and everything is working great! 
                     </p>

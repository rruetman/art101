			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Working with your partner, create a function that depend on conditionals. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I was expecting this lab to be more challenging but,it was actually pretty simple to navigate after 
                        referencing Wes' directions. I had some challenges with creating the conditional but my partner 
                        Milo's example was helpful on guiding me. Everything worked great for me after that fortunately! </p>

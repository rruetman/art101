					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to experiment using libraries and jQuery with a partner.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> A problem I ran into was navigating how to make my css special class changes appear on my local 
                        index.html file. After some trial and error, I realized I needed to nest a minor-section div class within 
                        each div class for challenge, problems, results, in order to allow my button to make css special class changes. 
                    </p>
                </div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The results of my lab 9 came out great! It was interesting to learn about the features of libraries like jQuery. 
                        It's super cool that you can create a button that changes the view of your site through accessing a library. 
                        I was able to make my button change my index.html file successfully with my favorite colors. </p>

			<p id="paragraph">Hii! I'm Ruby Ruetmann and I am a 4th year history major. 
				I love cats a lot! I have a white & brown tabby as well as an orange tabby cat.
				I'm taking this class to learn basic programming skills and create art with HTML. 
				My partner is named Milo Rodriguez and likes dinosaurs and Garfield. They are a 3rd year art major who likes to draw.
			    They also have minimal programming experience but we're figuring it out together! </p>

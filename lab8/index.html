					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This assignment was fairly simple for me once I understood how to use a callback function.
                        I figured out how to properly write one through experimenting in the browser console. I left out words 
                        when I was writing the multiplcation function but once referencing the class assignment example and asking a 
                        friend for help, I realized my errors. After that, the assignment was just copy and paste into my javascript file. 
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My Lab 8 results came out well and the process went smoothly. It was educational to practice using callbacks functions
                        and anonymous functions. I made some writing structure errors when creating a multiplication function
                        but I was able to realize my mistakes and get my desired results.

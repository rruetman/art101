			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this assignment was to practice pseudocoding in javascript. 
						I first started practicing pseudocoding with an everyday task. I broke down the steps to cook Spanish rice in an outlined list.
						The next challenge was to pseudocode a game, rock-paper-scissors, in javascript with my partner. 
						We successfully broke down the steps and sub-steps to play a game of rock-paper-scissors. 
						The final challenge was to input the psuedocode, images, and css into your lab4/index.html. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Lab 4 fortunately has gone smoothly for me thus far. 
						However, I had one small problem when making a css stylistic change, I could not figure out how to change the background color. 
						I solved the problem once I realized I could create an inline id tag within the body tag. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The Lab 4 assignment was overall simple and straightforward. It's intention was to teach us the basics of pseudocode
						 in preparation for javascript coding. I was able to clearly follow and understand tasks, producing the necessary outcome. 
						 All the text, content blocks, css changes, and images look great locally from my computer. I put substantial effort into this 
						 assignment to customize my page and complete all tasks to the best of my ability. </p>

					<pre><code>
					// Two players gather 
					// Each player extends one hand out
					// Each player makes a fist with their hand
					// Each player shakes their hand 3 times while saying rock-paper-scissors
					// After saying it 3 times, they show both of their hands 
					// Outcome 1:  Player1 shows Paper and Player 2 shows Rock
  						// Player 1 covers Rock and wins
					// Outcome 2:  Player 2 shows Scissors and Player 1 shows Paper
  						// Player 2 cuts paper and wins
					// Outcome 3 : Player1 show Rock and Player 2 shows Scissors
  						// Player 1 Rock crushes scissors and wins

			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Subject:</h2>
					<p>The subject of Lab 3 is to assess your understanding of file structures in one's computer. 
						This can encompass skills such as where to access files, to place them, how to edit them, etc. 
						The intention is that by navigating file structures & file transferring, practicing trial and error editing, 
						you will achieve one desired end result.
					 </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>A problem I encountered on this lab was attempting to create a class for one of the images on the art101/index.html. 
						I thought I had followed all the steps but, regardless, my second image failed to appear on the default browser. 
						As a solution, I created an img id instead of using an img class. 
						The additional change proved to be successful and my img appeared below my list.   </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>I am very satisfied with the results of my art 101/index.html. I like the layout, colors, and opportunity for images. 
					However, I wish I knew more structing skills of how to build content blocks and columns for images. 
					I wish I had a greater understanding of how to customize the layout more as well because I kept the same layout in fear
					that I would mess it up to beyond repair. Working by myself posed a new challenge that I was able to overcome by 
					doing a thorough review of the lab instructions as well as asking my CS friends questions when I needed support.

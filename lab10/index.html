					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My main issue with this lab was making my "Generate Text" button work properly. The random generated text 
                        was only appearing when I refreshed my page and not when I clicked my button. After re-visiting my code,
                        I realized that I hadn't included all my JavaScript functions in the event listener. 
                        I fixed my issue successfully!  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> After some trial and error, my function to generate fake dialogue was successful. A user can now click a button 
                        and manipulate words from The Bee Movie script. I ran into some roadblocks in building my JavaScript code 
                        but I triumphed! I'm excited to experiment with another feature in jQuery and learn more about how I can create 
                        more functions.
